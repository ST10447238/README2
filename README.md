# Purpose
The purpose of the Tamagotchi App is to educate and give people experience in terms of taking care of a virtual pet, just like the way they would with real ones. The App is made to keep people engaged with interactive activities such as feeding, cleaning, playing, and most importantly disciplining the pet.
# Design
The images above is the first step of the Tamagotchi application, which shows the activity main layout of the welcome page for the Tamagotchi App because in this application I have 5 activity main layouts which is important to use when starting an application. Basically, this is a petcare app/application that is made up of elements from the palette and it also has constraints. It consists of elements such as buttons, a text view, switches  and a background images. These elements are important because it will be used by the people on their devices. Each element in the image above has its role and function in this application, therefore I had to drag and drop the elements from the palette that I needed for the app. I started by dragging and dropping a textView which I had to rename it as “Welcome!!! To the Petcare App” which is the heading of the app and what the app is about, I have changed the text size by making it bold to make it easy for the people to see what this app is actually about and mainly deals with what. The second element that I have used in the image above is the first button that I had to rename the id to be btnBegin and the name of the button “Let’s Begin” which is the button that leads to the second page/activity main2 of the game where there are options I that page. Then the third element that I have used is the second button which the name of the button is Feed in the Second page /activity main2 which the id name is btnFeed when you press the button it will display an image that matches the concept in the button, then third button in the Second page /activity main2 which the id name is btnClean in the Second page /activity main2 which I also named the button Clean therefore the button will display/show the image that matches the concept of the button, and the fourth button in the Second page /activity main2 which the id name is btnPlay when you press the button it will display an image that matches the concept in the button which the name of the button is play. There are three buttons in the activity main3,4and5 which each of those activity mains which consists of a return button that is indicated in the layouts of those activity mains that shows when you press one of the buttons in the Second page /activity main2 you can be able to go back to those buttons in the Second page /activity main2 again. Then there are three switches with each button indicated on the second page /activity main2 is opposite to one of the switches. The switches each one of them indicate a specific status update in terms of feeding, cleaning, and playing with the virtual pet.Then the background pictures of the 5 activity main comes from PPP which the pictures are different and have a different meaning shown in the images above.
